Overview of thermofeel
======================================

*thermofeel* is a thermal indices library, with the aim of allowing these indices to \
be integrated in numerical weather prediction systems. It was developed and is maintained \
by ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts).



It contains in total 14 methods including 9 thermal indices:

* Relative Humidity (as water vapour pressure and percentage)
* Solar Zenith Angle (Instantaneous and Integrated)
* Mean Radiant Temperature (From Radiation and Wet Bulb Globe Temperature)
* Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI)
* Wet Bulb Globe Temperature from Mean Radiant Temperature
* Wet Bulb Globe Temperature Approx.
* Heat Index (Simplified and Adjusted)
* Humidex
* Net Effective Temperature
* Apparent Temperature
* Wind Chill
