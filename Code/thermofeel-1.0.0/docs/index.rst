Welcome to thermofeel's documentation!
======================================
thermofeel is a python library developed by ECMWF to integrate heat and thermal indexes \
into our internal systems and then ongoing maintenance.

It allows users to:

* Integrate our methods into their Numerical Weather Prediction Services.
* Calculate Heat and Thermal Indices from their own data.

This allows for transparency and reproducibility and allows users to expand \
the scope of these methods.
